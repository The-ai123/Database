# Database
This was my first major project that I have on github.

Note:This only contains code for the website server and the express server, it wont function on its own because it relies on a locally hosted database and a 'secret' document that has my ip which are not included on github

It had the original goal of simply hosting a database, and have a website interact with it. I had no knowelege of how to do this, all I knew was sql was a database and html was for websites

It ended with a mysql server and database that stored all the food/items my family has in stock, an express.js server that handled http requests with the mysql server, and a website server that hosted the html for the website and its scripts that allowed for its functionality. That being it showed a table of our items, allowed for adding/removing/updating the values from the website, and automatically generating a shopping list

I documented my progress and thoughts throughout its creation in a document included called 'Documention_notes for major project.pdf' and I have a video of its functionality here https://youtu.be/xksPe2qcbV8
